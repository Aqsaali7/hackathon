# Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics

- Lesson 2.1: Biomechanics and Humanoid Design
  Humanoid robots are engineered to mimic the form and function of the human body, presenting unique design challenges. This lesson explores the principles of biomechanics, analyzing human movement, balance, and structural integrity to inspire robotic design. We'll delve into the skeletal and muscular systems of humanoids, discussing materials, joint configurations, and actuation methods that enable them to perform complex human-like actions. The goal is to understand how biological insights translate into robust and agile robotic architectures.
- Lesson 2.2: Bipedal Locomotion and Stability
  Bipedal locomotion, the act of walking on two legs, is one of the most challenging feats for humanoid robots, requiring dynamic balance and precise control. This lesson covers the theories and techniques behind achieving stable bipedal gaits. Topics include the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) criterion, inverse kinematics, whole-body control, and various walking patterns (e.g., static, dynamic). We will also examine the role of sensory feedback from IMUs and force sensors in maintaining stability against disturbances, enabling humanoids to navigate diverse terrains.
- Lesson 2.3: Human-Robot Interaction and Social Robotics
  Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) focuses on designing robots that can communicate and collaborate effectively with humans. This lesson delves into the principles of HRI, emphasizing aspects of social robotics, where robots are designed to engage with people in a socially acceptable manner. We will cover verbal and non-verbal communication, understanding human intent, emotional recognition, and ethical considerations in deploying social robots. The goal is to create intuitive and comfortable interactions, making humanoids valuable companions and assistants in various settings.
- Lesson 2.4: Grasping and Dexterous Manipulation
  Grasping and dexterous manipulation are crucial capabilities for humanoids to interact effectively with their environment, from picking up objects to performing intricate tasks. This lesson explores the challenges involved, including object recognition, pose estimation, and force control. We will discuss various types of robotic hands and grippers, tactile sensing, and algorithms for planning stable grasps and complex manipulation sequences. The focus will be on understanding how humanoids can achieve human-like dexterity, adapting to different object properties and task requirements.
- Lesson 2.5: Case Studies of Famous Humanoid Robots
  To contextualize the theoretical concepts, this lesson presents in-depth case studies of prominent humanoid robots that have pushed the boundaries of the field. We will examine their design philosophies, technological innovations, and the specific challenges they were built to overcome. Examples may include ASIMO, Atlas, HRP series, and Sophia, among others. By analyzing their successes and limitations, students will gain a practical understanding of how theoretical principles are applied in real-world humanoid robotics development and the future directions of the field.
