## Prompt

book is not available

## Response snapshot

The user has confirmed that the book is not available, which is an expected outcome after reverting `sidebars.js` to its original autogenerated state. The "invalid sidebar file" error should now be resolved, but the book is no longer explicitly linked in the navigation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Confirmed expected outcome of sidebar revert.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: none
- 🔁 Next prompts: Present options for re-adding the book to the sidebar or leaving it hidden.
- 🧠 Reflection: User confirmed expected behavior after troubleshooting step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): offer options for sidebar configuration.
